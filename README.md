> [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/qinb6j/httpsgithubcomzdharma_has_suddenly_disappeared_i/hil4oww/) by me explains how this org came into existence. Copied below in case it is removed.

TL;DR: I'm putting up clones of all of his tools I depend on in this org: https://github.com/zdharma-continuum
I no longer trust /u/psprint2 as a maintainer and will provide a reliable way for myself and others to depend on the work he's invested in. I do not have any personal issues with him, and would welcome his continued contributions.

While I appreciate the work that /u/psprint2 has put into building and maintaining all of these tools, I no longer find him an justifiable dependency. He has demonstrated his complete unreliability twice now.

1 year ago, [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/fhc6kg/the_proof_that_theres_nothing_going_on_with_zinit/) popped up.

> I'm the projects' owner and I can delete them anytime I want. And that just happened – I've had some say major doubts whether I want the time-consuming projects to go on, so I've deleted them

**You can delete them any time you want -- at the cost of your credibility as a maintainer.**

I will never directly depend on a source maintained by you in the future. If you can not be trusted to not take destructive actions, a buffer (a fork) must be put in place.

I'm putting up forks of the most-recent copies of the sources that I depend on personally (and thus have up-to-date clones of) in an organization on github. I'm happy to give maintainer privileges to people with a demonstrated previous interest / contributions to zsh / zinint / zdharma (by way of commit hashes, google cached github issues pages, wayback machine, whatever). 

I have no interest in dealing with errors like "sorry, the tools you built your zsh workflow on couldn't be cloned because /u/psprint2 had a mood swing and decided to delete them."

Archive them, resign as maintainer, I don't care. Just don't delete all the source code on a random Thursday without any notice.

Note that some of this damage is seemingly irreversible. I can’t find a way to access the zinit wiki source, for instance.

I would love a response from /u/psprint2.

## I am a previous maintainer / contributor to `zdharma`

Great, open an issue with a link to a commit you wrote or something to prove it.

## I am not a previous contributor

You can help by finding forks / clones and sending them my way :)
