TL;DR: I'm putting up clones of all of his tools I depend on in this org:
https://github.com/zdharma-continuum. I no longer trust /u/psprint2 as a
maintainer and will provide a reliable way for myself and others to rely on
the work he's invested in. I do not have any personal issues with him and would
welcome his continued contributions.

While I appreciate the work that /u/psprint2 has put into building and
maintaining these tools, I no longer find him a justifiable dependency.
He has demonstrated his complete unreliability twice now.

popped up.

**You can delete them any time you want -- at the cost of your credibility as a
maintainer.**

I don't want to depend on a source maintained by someone who can't be trusted to 
not take destructive actions, so a buffer (a fork) must be put in place.

I'm putting up forks of the most recent copies of the sources that I depend on
personally (and thus have up-to-date clones of) in an organization on Github.
I'm happy to give maintainer privileges to people with a demonstrated previous
interest/contributions to zsh / zinint / zdharma (by way of commit hashes,
google cached GitHub issues pages, Wayback machine, etc.).

I have no interest in dealing with errors like "sorry, the tools you built your 
zsh workflow on couldn't be cloned because someone randomly deleted them."

Archive them, resign as maintainer; I don't care. Don't delete all the source
code on a random Thursday without any notice.
